Contributor Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

Public or private harassment

Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

SafeAgent Core Principles
In addition to the general standards of behavior, all contributions to SafeAgent must align with the core technical principles of the project. We are building a framework for enterprise-grade AI systems, and our code must reflect that mission.

All new features and code contributions should, to the greatest extent possible, be designed with the following principles in mind:

Production-Ready by Design: Contributions should be robust, reliable, and performant. This includes writing clean code, providing effective tests, and considering how a feature will behave under real-world load and failure conditions. The goal is to build features that are immediately trustworthy for production use.

Increased Data Governance: Contributions should enhance, or at a minimum, respect the framework's commitment to security and data governance. Features that handle data or provide new capabilities (e.g., tools, sinks) must be designed with security in mind, respecting policies like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Enhanced Observability: Contributions should integrate with our existing GovernanceManager and logging systems. The ability to audit and understand every action an agent takes is paramount. New features must provide the necessary "hooks" or direct logging to ensure that their operations are transparent and observable.

By contributing to SafeAgent, you agree that your work will uphold these core principles, ensuring the project remains a dependable and secure foundation for production LLM agents.

Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
